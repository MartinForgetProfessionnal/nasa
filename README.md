# My NASA API app

This project was meant to be a school project, but i pushed a little bit the limit to learn more stuff and have fun.

## To start the project

### `open with Visual Studio Code`

To view the project, you just need to open its folder with Visual Studio Code.

### `npm start`

In the terminal, just type npm start.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Project Description

This project is using 2 different queries for pictures, medias and diverse informations from 2 Nasa's APIs. 
The first one is used to show the daily picture published by the NASA and its description. 
The second one, i managed to build a dynamic querie with inputs with it. That way, the user can choose the date and the camera from the Curiosity rover which is actively exploring and gatherig datas on Mars.

## NASA API

To see those free enjoyable NASA APIs just follow the link [https://api.nasa.gov/](https://api.nasa.gov/). 
In my project, i've used APOD and MARS ROVER PHOTOS(focused on Curiosity. I'll possibly implement my work with other rovers later)
